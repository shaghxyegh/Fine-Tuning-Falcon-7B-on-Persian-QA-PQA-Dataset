# Fine-Tuning-Falcon-7B-on-Persian-QA-PQA-Dataset
My first fine-tuning attempt on Falcon-7B for Persian QA using Colab T4 GPU. Overcame dataset loading errors (RuntimeError on scripts), overfitting (adjusted epochs), and T4 VRAM limits. Training didn't complete due to model size. Achieved partial run (step 51/125). Challenges: Transformers complexities. Future: Complete on A100, evaluate F1/EM
